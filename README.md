# micro-libary-information-system
This project are about creating a microservices architectural desgin for a library information system. I created this project with Javascript, Node.js, Express, Docker, MongoDB.
Noticed that this is just my first commit and i really dont know what's "depend" command on docker-compose but it worked so yeah, more update to come.
I havent make a full front-end yet, just the API Gateway. but i hope i can make it soon!
