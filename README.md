# micro-libary-information-system
This project are about creating a microservices architectural desgin for a library information system. I created this project with Javascript, Node.js, Express, Docker, MongoDB.
Noticed that this is just my first commit and i really dont know what's "depend" command on docker-compose but it worked so yeah, more update to come.
I havent make a full front-end yet, just the API Gateway. but i hope i can make it soon!

1. You need to run docker.
2. npm install init on every folder
3. docker-compose build
3. run docker-compose by typing on terminal (i use vsc), docker compose up --d
4. it works! but if you cant see it on localhost, use 192.168.l00.1 instead.
5. if you want to stop the docker container, then use docker compose down.
